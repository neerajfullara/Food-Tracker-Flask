# Food-Tracker-Flask
The Food Tracker web application was developed using Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python web framework, which enabled rapid development and easy integration with the SQLite database.

To store and manage data related to food entries, including date, food name, and nutrition details such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat, we utilized SQLite3, a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration SQL database engine.

The user interface was designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for inputting food data and viewing calorie counts.

We also implemented advanced functionality for users to input food details along with the date, calculate the total calorie count for each day, and review entries by date, providing them with a comprehensive food tracking and analysis tool.
